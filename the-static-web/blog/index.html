        <h2 class="blogtitle">Sega Dreamcast</h2>
        <section>I've been an avid lover of Sega's last gaming system since its launch in September, 1999. My parents believed in buying books (not games), and I had to create my own business at the age of 13 to be able to have that system. It was the beginning of my entrepreneurial endeavors. </section><br>
